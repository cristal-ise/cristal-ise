# Description-Driven Framework for No-Code/Low-Code Application Development 
Main repository of the [CRISTAL-iSE Description-Driven Framework](http://cristal-ise.github.io/).

CRISTAL-iSE is a description-driven software platform originally developed to track the construction of the CMS ECAL detector of the LHC at CERN. It consists of a core library, known as the kernel, which manages business objects called Items. Items are entirely configured from data, called descriptions, held in other Items. Every change of a state in an Item is a consequence of an execution of an activity in that Item's lifecycle, meaning that CRISTAL-iSE applications are completely traceable, even in their design. It also supports extensive versioning of Item description data, giving the system a high level of flexibility.
