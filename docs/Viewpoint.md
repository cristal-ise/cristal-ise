A Viewpoint is a named version of an [[Outcome]], usually either the latest Outcome generated by a particular [[Activity]], or of a particular [[XMLSchema]]. Activities may be repeated or be reused many times in the Workflow, which can create multiple versions of the same Outcomes, and finding the latest version of a particular outcome would be expensive if queries would have to account for this fact using date range checks or similar grouping functions. So the Viewpoint exists as a pointer to the accepted 'current' version of an Outcome. It is automatically updated during Activity execution, but may be set manually by administrators to perform rollbacks.

On Activity execution, a `'last'` viewpoint for the Outcome schema is always written automatically, pointing to the current version. An Activity may specify one `'Viewpoint'` property to create an additional Viewpoint
* by giving it a name
* by giving an xpath expression  to select a value from the actual Outcome
  * example: `xpath:/TestOutcome/StrinValue`

The name of the Viewpoint may contain **alphanumeric** characters only.

### Viewpoint for Versioning of Descriptions

Viewpoint is used to implement Versioning of [[Description]] Items. (TBD)
