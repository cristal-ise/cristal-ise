The Workflow object is the container for all [[Activities|Activity]] in an [[Item]]. It resolves all activity paths from execution requests to individual Activities, and passes requests to them. Its contents are fixed as two [[CompositeActivities|CompositeActivity]]: one PredefinedStepContainer, which is a non-persistent container for all implemented [[PredefinedStep]]s, and a persistent CompositeActivity that contains the domain workflow, instantiated from a Workflow description. Workflow descriptions can be any self-contained CompositeActivity description Item.

During Item initialization, the Workflow object activates the first Activity of the domain workflow, enabling execution.
