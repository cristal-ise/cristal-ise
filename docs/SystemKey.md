The unique identifier of an Item, used in Item resolution and remote calls. In previous versions this was an integer tracked by a special sequence in the LDAP tree, but this has been replaced with a Class 4 UUID, so should be globally unique and preserved between Items copied to different servers in modules. Over CORBA calls, this UUID is serialized as two 64-bit integers, defined in CORBA in the `SystemKey` struct.
