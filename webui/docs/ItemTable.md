- List of Items of the same Type, e.g. WorkOrders, normally linked with a MenuItem 
- List of Items in a Collection of an Item, e.g. WorkOrders of a Customer

ItemTable is linked with a Schema that definies its coloumns, it is either the MasterSchema or the Schema describing the Collection members.
